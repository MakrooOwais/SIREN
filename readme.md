# SIREN: Synthetic Image Recognition and Explanation Network

## Overview
This repository hosts the **SIREN** project, the winning solution for the InterIIT Tech Meet 13.0. The project focuses on detecting AI-generated images and generating interpretable explanations for their classification. SIREN comprises two main components:

1. **SIREN-𝛿**: A robust classifier to distinguish real images from AI-generated ones.
2. **SIREN-𝛼**: An explainability pipeline for artifact identification and explanation generation.

---

## Problem Statement
With the proliferation of advanced generative AI models, ensuring the authenticity of digital content has become crucial. AI-generated images often contain subtle artifacts that differentiate them from real images. SIREN addresses this challenge by:

- Accurately classifying images as real or AI-generated.
- Generating human-interpretable explanations for the classification, including artifact identification and localization.

---

## Dataset
### CIFAKE Dataset
- **Training Data**: CIFAKE, containing 120,000 labeled samples of real and synthetic images, with subjects from CIFAR-10 classes.
- **SIREN-63K Dataset**: Augmented dataset created by the team with 64,086 samples (30,000 real and 34,086 fake) derived from ImageNet-1k and various generative models.

---

## Solution Approach
### SIREN-𝛿: Classification of Real vs. AI-Generated Images
- **Model**: EfficientNet_B2_S with adversarial robustness.
- **Training**: Purification-based techniques to enhance resistance against adversarial attacks.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved 94.23% on the SIREN-63K dataset.

### SIREN-𝛼: Artifact Detection and Explanation Generation
- **Artifact Detection**:
  - Leveraged CLIP-ViT embeddings for artifact relevance.
  - Trained multi-label classifiers for CIFAR class-specific artifacts.
- **Artifact Explanation**:
  - Used GPT-4 to generate descriptors and CLIPSeg for localization maps.
  - Provided explanations with identifiers for detected artifacts.

## Results
### Task 1: Classification Metrics
| Model             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| EfficientNet_B2_S | 94.23%   | 94.25%    | 94.23% | 94.23%   |

### Task 2: Artifact Explanation
- Achieved high relevance between predicted artifacts and ground truth.
- Localization maps effectively highlight artifact regions.

---

## Limitations
- Dataset imbalance for certain generative models.
- Limited descriptor granularity due to computational constraints.
- Reduced scalability to novel artifacts and adaptive adversarial attacks.
